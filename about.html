<h2>Hello!</h2>

<p>My name is Christina Yoong. This is the start of my client website. I am experimenting with Git, GitHub, and Atom.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>I am pursuing the Graduate Certificate in Technical Communication at the University of Minnesota.</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>I plan to create multiple pages for this site. This is my first time using these technologies, so it is taking time to set up. I quite enjoy working with HTML and seeing the code come to life. I would love to incorporate some CSS and Javascript soon, too, so the front-end design appears smoother. I want to watch the Lynda HTML tutorial, especially if it gives best practices for organizing the code within Atom or other text editors.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>I was a bit confused finding where I can open the terminal on Mac as well as how to sync the gh-pages with the master branch, but it was actually musch simpler than I had thought. I need to look up the best way to open the saved file in Atom (if there is a best way?),because I was also having trouble knowing if I had the correct project open. Maybe I was overthinking. Anyway, onward!</p>
