Charitable Event
Our special philanthropic collaboration this year benefits Waypoint Services. UMACRAO attendees will be filling “bags of hope” on Wednesday night for homeless or nearly homeless individuals in need of assistance. Before the conference begins, please consider bringing one or more of the following items to donate:
Snack foods (e.g., granola bars, fruit snacks, nut mixes, trail mix, etc.)
Bottled water
Socks, gloves, hats
Hygiene items (e.g., deodorant, travel toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.)
Items should be placed in a paper sack, reusable bag, or gallon/quart ziplock bag. More information can be found on the registration form. Please join us in supporting this amazing organization!
Waypoint Services provides comprehensive domestic violence victim services, emergency shelter and housing solutions, high quality affordable childcare and empowering the community to change lives. Since 1894, Waypoint has remained dedicated to moving people forward through proactive services and resources.

Keynote Speaker(s)
We welcome Kirkwood Community College’s new President, Dr. Lori Sundberg, and the University of Iowa’s Vice President for Student Life and Interim Chief Diversity Officer, Dr. Melissa S. Shivers, on the final day of our conference.
